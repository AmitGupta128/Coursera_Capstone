    "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 in 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America. and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having such vast population and big geographical area, naturally there is a huge competition between businesses. Hence it is very difficult for new businesses to open in the area to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Target Audience: ** New business owners who want to open a new restaurant in the city of Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to recommend which might be the best locality for new business owners to open a new restaurant so that they can turn a profit with low competition risk."
